*This repository is a solution for infotecs.ru intership as example of my code*

This directory contains solution of the second task about RSS Reader. 
My solution was implemented with use of WPF, also source code includes some MIT Licensed code (HTMLConverter namespace) I used and modified which. Since MIT License necessitates me to include it, next to README.md there is a MIT-LICENSE.md file which contains it, but it affects only HTMLConerter sources.

All extra tasks were completed:
 - Configuration is stored in XML file using standart Settings mechanism. Configuration is stored under `%HOMEDIR%\AppData\Local\RssReader\`.
 - Under `File->Settings` you can specify feeds, update frequency and enable or disable HTML formatting
 - All settings are validating
 - You can enable or disable specific feed in Feeds section
 - HTML formatting by default is enabled and you can disable it in settings
